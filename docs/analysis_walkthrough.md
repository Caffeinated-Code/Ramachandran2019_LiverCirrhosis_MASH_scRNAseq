# Analysis Walkthrough

This walkthrough explains the analysis methods, why each choice was made, what the results mean, and where the interpretation stays cautious. It is written to be readable by a computational biologist, a translational scientist, or a wet-lab collaborator reviewing the work.

## 1. Analysis Design

The primary question is:

> Which cell-state-linked genes in human liver fibrosis are plausible biomarkers, pharmacodynamic readouts, therapeutic hypotheses, or validation priorities?

The workflow starts from GEO count matrices rather than a precomputed object. That makes the analysis reproducible and keeps the published Seurat object in the right role: annotation support, not the source of truth.

Main code paths:

- [workflow/02_curate_metadata.R](../workflow/02_curate_metadata.R): sample manifest and inclusion/exclusion logic
- [workflow/03_compact_analysis.R](../workflow/03_compact_analysis.R): Seurat preprocessing, clustering, UMAP, marker scoring, exploratory DE
- [workflow/07_refine_annotations.R](../workflow/07_refine_annotations.R): reference-informed label refinement
- [workflow/08_pseudobulk_de.R](../workflow/08_pseudobulk_de.R): donor-level pseudobulk DE
- [workflow/04_prioritize_targets.R](../workflow/04_prioritize_targets.R): pathway enrichment and target scoring
- [workflow/13_validate_blood_mouse_markers.R](../workflow/13_validate_blood_mouse_markers.R): blood specificity and mouse conservation checks

The analysis keeps one rule throughout: discovery evidence, validation evidence, and translational evidence are separate layers. A candidate becomes more credible when those layers agree.

## 2. Dataset And Metadata Curation

Primary dataset: **GSE136103**, human cirrhotic and healthy liver scRNA-seq from Ramachandran et al.

The GEO archive contains human liver, human blood, and mouse liver libraries. The primary contrast uses only human liver tissue:

```text
healthy human liver
  vs
cirrhotic human liver
```

Blood and mouse samples are not mixed into that contrast because they answer different questions. Blood can test whether candidates are broad circulating signals. Mouse can test whether orthologs move in the expected direction for preclinical follow-up. Mixing them into the primary model would confound disease with tissue and species.

Output:

- [data/metadata/gse136103_sample_manifest.csv](../data/metadata/gse136103_sample_manifest.csv)

Interpretation:

- The primary analysis is a clean human liver disease comparison.
- The secondary blood and mouse modules increase translational confidence without weakening the primary contrast.

## 3. QC And Preprocessing

Seurat is used for local analysis because it is widely used, installed in the local environment, and appropriate for a compact R-based single-cell workflow.

Workflow:

```text
GEO matrix per library
  -> Seurat object per library
  -> merge primary human liver libraries
  -> JoinLayers for Seurat v5 compatibility
  -> QC filter
  -> NormalizeData
  -> FindVariableFeatures
  -> ScaleData
  -> RunPCA
  -> FindNeighbors
  -> FindClusters
  -> RunUMAP
```

The compact workflow uses:

- minimum detected genes: 200
- mitochondrial cutoff: 25 percent
- variable genes: 3,000
- PCA dimensions used for graph and UMAP: 1:20
- clustering resolution: 0.5

Why these choices are conservative:

- Fibrotic liver contains stressed and injured cells. A very strict mitochondrial cutoff can remove real disease biology.
- The 200-gene minimum removes obvious low-complexity droplets without trying to over-optimize every sample.
- QC is summarized by library and compartment so the filter can be audited.

Outputs:

- [reports/tables/qc_by_library.csv](../reports/tables/qc_by_library.csv)
- [reports/tables/qc_filtered_by_library_compartment.csv](../reports/tables/qc_filtered_by_library_compartment.csv)

Caution:

- This compact workflow does not claim full production-grade doublet or ambient RNA correction. A production run should add scDblFinder/DoubletFinder and SoupX/CellBender/DecontX, then verify that activated stromal, macrophage, and endothelial disease states are not removed.

## 4. Why UMAP Instead Of t-SNE

UMAP and t-SNE are both visualization methods. Neither is used for statistical inference.

UMAP is used here because:

- it is fast for tens of thousands of cells
- it is standard in Seurat workflows
- it preserves local neighborhoods well enough for cell-state inspection
- it usually gives a more useful view of broader activation continua than default t-SNE

This matters in fibrosis because disease biology is often gradual:

```text
quiescent stromal cell
  -> activated HSC-like state
  -> collagen-rich myofibroblast-like state
```

UMAP helps inspect those transitions. It does not prove that two far-apart clusters are biologically distant, and it is not used for differential expression.

Outputs:

- [reports/figures/umap_disease_state.png](../reports/figures/umap_disease_state.png)
- [reports/figures/umap_required_compartments.png](../reports/figures/umap_required_compartments.png)
- [reports/figures/umap_refined_cell_states.png](../reports/figures/umap_refined_cell_states.png)

Interpretation:

- UMAP by disease checks whether disease states occupy distinct parts of transcriptomic space.
- UMAP by compartment checks whether marker-supported populations are coherent.
- UMAP by refined label checks whether reference-informed labels align with marker evidence.

## 5. Published Seurat Object As Annotation Reference

The published Ramachandran Seurat object contains expert annotations from the original study. The workflow uses it as a reference layer, not as the primary data source.

The distinction matters:

| Role | Input | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Primary analysis | GEO count matrices | reproducible from public input |
| Annotation support | published Seurat metadata | leverages expert labels without inheriting the full serialized analysis |

The reference object includes metadata fields such as:

- `annotation_lineage`: broad lineage label
- `annotation_indepth`: more detailed annotation

The workflow compares rebuilt clusters against those labels and writes refined cluster annotations.

Output:

- [reports/tables/refined_cluster_annotations.csv](../reports/tables/refined_cluster_annotations.csv)

The dashboard Reference Labels view joins these cluster annotations to the cell-level UMAP metadata and adds:

- `cluster_cells`: number of cells in each Seurat cluster
- `cluster_composition_pct`: percent of all displayed cells in that cluster
- `healthy_pct` and `cirrhotic_pct`: disease composition within the cluster
- `donors`: number of donors represented in the cluster

Interpretation:

- The reference helps prevent under-calling known fibrotic niche populations.
- Cluster size and disease composition help distinguish a robust repeated state from a small or disease-skewed cluster that needs cautious interpretation.
- The count matrices remain the reproducible input, so the work is not just a reuse of an RData object.

## 6. Compartment Identification

The requested disease-relevant compartments were identified using marker programs defined in [config/project.yaml](../config/project.yaml).

These three compartments make biological sense because they cover the scar niche from three angles: stromal/HSC-myofibroblast cells produce matrix, macrophage/monocyte states coordinate injury and repair, and endothelial cells remodel vascular and immune trafficking interfaces. A short biology primer is available here: [biology_primer_liver_fibrosis.md](biology_primer_liver_fibrosis.md).

| Compartment | Markers | Biological purpose |
|---|---|---|
| HSC/mesenchymal/myofibroblast-like | COL1A1, COL3A1, ACTA2, TAGLN, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, LUM, DCN, RGS5 | scar-producing stromal program |
| Macrophage/monocyte | TREM2, CD9, SPP1, GPNMB, LST1, C1QA, C1QB, C1QC | injury-associated immune remodeling |
| Endothelial | ACKR1, PLVAP, VWF, PECAM1, KDR, RAMP2, ENG | scar-associated vascular remodeling |

The code calculates marker scores and assigns a broad compartment if one program is clearly highest and above threshold. Cells without enough evidence remain `other_or_unresolved`.

Technically, this is a transparent marker-scoring rule using the Seurat-normalized RNA `data` layer. The helper averages each marker set per cell, compares the three required compartment scores, and assigns the highest-scoring compartment only when the score clears the threshold.

Why this is appropriate:

- The assignment required these broad compartments.
- Marker programs are transparent and auditable.
- Conservative labels avoid pretending that compact analysis can fully resolve activated HSCs, portal fibroblasts, pericytes, and myofibroblast states.

Key output:

- [reports/figures/required_compartment_marker_dotplot.png](../reports/figures/required_compartment_marker_dotplot.png)

Caution:

- Activated stromal subtypes overlap. COL1A1, COL3A1, ACTA2, TAGLN, PDGFRB, LUM, and DCN support a fibrogenic stromal state, but finer subtype labels need deeper subclustering, spatial context, and protein validation.

## 7. Differential Expression

Two DE layers are kept because they serve different purposes.

### Cell-Level DE

Cell-level DE is run with Seurat `FindMarkers` inside each broad compartment:

```text
subset compartment
  -> cirrhotic cells vs healthy cells
  -> Wilcoxon test
  -> exploratory marker table
```

Output:

- [reports/tables/compartment_de_cell_level_exploratory.csv](../reports/tables/compartment_de_cell_level_exploratory.csv)

Purpose:

- fast screening
- obvious marker discovery
- input to early pathway and candidate scoring

Why Wilcoxon and FDR:

- Wilcoxon is a common Seurat default for exploratory single-cell marker detection because it is rank-based and does not assume normally distributed expression.
- FDR correction is used because thousands of genes are tested at once; it controls the expected proportion of false discoveries among called genes.
- This layer is deliberately exploratory. Donor-level pseudobulk is the stronger evidence layer for nomination.

Pitfall:

```text
one donor with 8,000 macrophages
another donor with 500 macrophages
another donor with 300 macrophages

cell-level DE sees 8,800 cells
biology sees 3 donors
```

If one donor has a strong idiosyncratic signal, thousands of cells from that donor can dominate the p-value. That is why cell-level DE is not the final evidence layer.

### Donor-Level Pseudobulk DE

Pseudobulk aggregates raw counts by donor and refined cell state:

```text
cells from one donor and one cell state
  -> sum raw counts per gene
  -> one donor-level profile
  -> limma model: expression ~ disease
```

Output:

- [reports/tables/pseudobulk_de_by_refined_state.csv](../reports/tables/pseudobulk_de_by_refined_state.csv)
- [reports/tables/pseudobulk_priority_gene_de.csv](../reports/tables/pseudobulk_priority_gene_de.csv)

What it teaches:

- COL1A1, COL3A1, TIMP1, and PDGFRA gain donor-level support in HSC/myofibroblast-like states.
- ACKR1 has strong endothelial support.
- Macrophage candidates remain biologically important but need a macrophage-focused external atlas before target nomination.

Caveats:

- Rare cell states may be excluded if too few donors or cells are available.
- Broad annotations can dilute substate-specific signal.
- A larger production run should consider edgeR, DESeq2, muscat, or dreamlet depending on design and covariates.

## 8. Pathway And Mechanism Analysis

The workflow uses two complementary pathway views. The first is Hallmark over-representation analysis on direction-specific disease-associated genes. "Higher in cirrhosis" means positive cirrhotic-versus-healthy fold change; "lower in cirrhosis" means the opposite direction. This is an EnrichR-style question: given a list of genes moving in one direction, which curated pathway sets are overrepresented? It is fast, transparent, and useful for broad mechanism themes.

Output:

- [reports/tables/hallmark_pathway_enrichment.csv](../reports/tables/hallmark_pathway_enrichment.csv)

Interpretation:

- Stromal states show matrix remodeling and EMT-like programs.
- Endothelial states show vascular remodeling, junction, and coagulation-linked programs.
- Macrophage states show injury, repair, lipid-handling, and metabolic programs.

Pathway enrichment is not proof of causality. It summarizes the biology that should guide validation.

### pathfindR From Pseudobulk DE

pathfindR is the second pathway view. It adds value beyond EnrichR-style over-representation because it first asks whether donor-supported disease-associated genes form connected active subnetworks in protein-interaction space, then tests pathway enrichment on those subnetworks. That is useful for target prioritization: a connected collagen-processing, matrix-remodeling, or vascular-remodeling module is more interpretable and experimentally actionable than a loose list of genes that happen to overlap the same pathway.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A["Pseudobulk DE table"] --> B["Cirrhosis-up genes by cell state"]
  B --> C["Map genes to interaction network"]
  C --> D["Find active subnetworks"]
  D --> E["Enrich KEGG, Reactome, GO terms"]
  E --> F["Cluster redundant pathways"]
  F --> G["Mechanism figure and target rationale"]
```

How it is used here:

- input is donor-level pseudobulk DE, not cell-level DE
- significant genes in either direction with FDR < 0.05 are used, with signed log fold change preserved
- Reactome terms are tested from active subnetworks
- HSC/myofibroblast and endothelial states have enough genes to run
- macrophage states are not forced because they do not have enough donor-supported cirrhosis-up genes in this compact run

Outputs:

- [reports/tables/pathfindr_pseudobulk_run_summary.csv](../reports/tables/pathfindr_pseudobulk_run_summary.csv)
- [reports/tables/pathfindr_pseudobulk_reactome_enrichment.csv](../reports/tables/pathfindr_pseudobulk_reactome_enrichment.csv)
- [reports/figures/pathfindr_pseudobulk_reactome_barplot.png](../reports/figures/pathfindr_pseudobulk_reactome_barplot.png)
- [reports/figures/pathfindr_pseudobulk_reactome_dotplot.png](../reports/figures/pathfindr_pseudobulk_reactome_dotplot.png)

![pathfindR Reactome bar plot](../reports/figures/pathfindr_pseudobulk_reactome_barplot.png)

The bar plot shows the strongest Reactome terms from significant pseudobulk signatures after the active-subnetwork step. This makes the HSC/myofibroblast matrix module easy to inspect.

![pathfindR Reactome dot plot](../reports/figures/pathfindr_pseudobulk_reactome_dotplot.png)

The dot plot shows both enrichment strength and the number of significant pseudobulk genes supporting each term. This helps separate a pathway with broad donor-supported gene evidence from one driven by only a few genes.

Result:

- HSC/myofibroblast pseudobulk DE strongly supports extracellular matrix organization, collagen formation, collagen biosynthesis/modification, elastic fiber biology, collagen crosslinking, extracellular matrix degradation, and integrin interactions.
- Endothelial pseudobulk DE produces donor-supported Reactome terms where the vascular remodeling signature is sufficient.
- Macrophage mechanisms should be pursued with a stronger macrophage-specific atlas or validation dataset, rather than overinterpreting weak local pseudobulk signal.

## 9. Biomarker And Target Prioritization

The scoring model is rule-based because the donor count is small and interpretability matters. The goal is not to rank genes by p-value. The goal is to decide which genes are useful, assayable, conserved, and safe enough to move forward.

Code:

- [workflow/04_prioritize_targets.R](../workflow/04_prioritize_targets.R)

Outputs:

- [reports/tables/ranked_biomarker_target_candidates_translational.csv](../reports/tables/ranked_biomarker_target_candidates_translational.csv)
- [reports/tables/target_prioritization_scoring_components.csv](../reports/tables/target_prioritization_scoring_components.csv)
- [reports/tables/target_prioritization_scoring_method.csv](../reports/tables/target_prioritization_scoring_method.csv)

Scoring logic:

```text
total score =
  disease association
+ donor-level pseudobulk support
+ compartment specificity
+ pathway coherence
+ external validation
+ modality and assayability
+ mouse conservation
- safety and tissue-specificity risk
- blood specificity penalty
- therapeutic risk penalty
```

Important guardrail:

- Donor-level pseudobulk credit is awarded only when the signal appears in the candidate's intended compartment.
- For example, PLVAP should be supported by endothelial signal. HSC-like PLVAP signal is treated cautiously because it may reflect scar-niche proximity, ambient RNA, doublets, or mixed clusters.

Candidate categories:

| Category | Meaning | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Diagnostic biomarker | helps detect disease state or fibrosis burden | SMOC2, COL1A1, COL3A1, PLVAP |
| Pharmacodynamic biomarker | tracks response to intervention | TIMP1, CD9, GPNMB |
| Therapeutic target | plausible intervention point | PDGFRA, PDGFRB |
| Future validation marker | strong biology, not ready for nomination | TREM2, SPP1, ACKR1 |

The dashboard includes dropdowns for candidate class and clinical use case.

## 10. Validation

Validation is treated as independent support, not as a merged atlas. The datasets have different assays and processing histories, so the safer approach is to harmonize gene symbols, disease labels, and broad compartments, then test whether candidates move in the expected direction.

| Dataset | What it validates | Main metadata | Main caution |
|---|---|---|---|
| GSE244832 | MASH-relevant HSC/myofibroblast expression | condition, focused compartment, candidate expression | processed object, so not a full raw reanalysis |
| GSE207310 | bulk human NAFLD/NASH directionality | disease label, fibrosis grade, biopsy metadata | bulk signal cannot identify cell of origin |
| GSE136103 blood | circulating expression and specificity risk | blood library IDs and candidate expression | not a liver fibrosis contrast |
| GSE136103 mouse | ortholog conservation and preclinical direction | mouse healthy/fibrotic liver labels | small screen, not powered mouse DE |

A validation result is strongest when the same candidate has the same disease direction, appears in the expected compartment or tissue context, and survives enough metadata QC to trust the comparison. PCA or correlation heatmaps are useful in a larger harmonized atlas; here, trend plots and directionality bars are clearer because the validation datasets are intentionally kept separate.

### GSE244832

Role: MASH/MASLD HSC and myofibroblast validation.

Why it adds value:

- human liver
- MASH-relevant labels
- strong HSC activation focus

Output:

- [reports/tables/gse244832_focused_object_candidate_summary.csv](../reports/tables/gse244832_focused_object_candidate_summary.csv)
- [reports/figures/gse244832_focused_object_validation_heatmap.png](../reports/figures/gse244832_focused_object_validation_heatmap.png)

Interpretation:

- SMOC2, TIMP1, PDGFRA, and PDGFRB show useful HSC-like validation signal.
- COL1A1 and COL3A1 remain strong burden markers.

### GSE207310

Role: bulk liver NAFLD/NASH directionality.

Why it adds value:

- human biopsy RNA-seq
- phenotype metadata
- independent support for candidate directionality

Output:

- [reports/tables/validation_gse207310_candidate_lm_results.csv](../reports/tables/validation_gse207310_candidate_lm_results.csv)

Caution:

- Bulk RNA-seq supports directionality but cannot identify cell of origin.

### Blood And Mouse From GSE136103

Role:

- blood: circulating marker specificity
- mouse: ortholog conservation and preclinical directionality

Outputs:

- [reports/tables/gse136103_blood_candidate_marker_role_summary.csv](../reports/tables/gse136103_blood_candidate_marker_role_summary.csv)
- [reports/tables/gse136103_mouse_candidate_ortholog_summary.csv](../reports/tables/gse136103_mouse_candidate_ortholog_summary.csv)

Interpretation:

- TIMP1 and LST1 are detectable in blood, so they need context-aware interpretation.
- Most stromal, endothelial, and collagen candidates are low or absent in blood, supporting liver-niche specificity.
- Fibrotic mouse liver shows strongest directionality for macrophage-state orthologs such as Trem2, Spp1, Gpnmb, Cd9, and complement genes.
- Mouse stromal support is weaker in the two-sample screen and should be expanded in a larger preclinical dataset.

## 11. Translational Interpretation

The current MASH treatment landscape changes how the target list should be used. Approved therapies such as resmetirom and semaglutide address metabolic disease biology and histologic improvement in noncirrhotic MASH with moderate-to-advanced fibrosis. A single-cell fibrosis workflow should add value by identifying cell-state biomarkers, pharmacodynamic readouts, and more precise stromal or immune hypotheses.

Priority action plan:

| Track | Candidates | First experiment |
|---|---|---|
| Biomarker and pharmacodynamic | SMOC2, TIMP1, COL1A1, COL3A1, PLVAP, ACKR1 | tissue localization, serum/plasma assay feasibility, longitudinal response |
| Stromal perturbation | PDGFRA, PDGFRB | HSC spheroids, co-culture, precision-cut liver slices |
| Macrophage mechanism | TREM2, CD9, SPP1, GPNMB | macrophage atlas validation, spatial proximity, ligand-receptor analysis |

Clinical and industry context:

- Resmetirom/Rezdiffra from Madrigal targets THRB. It is not one of the candidates, but it shows the value of liver-directed metabolic therapy in F2-F3 MASH.
- Semaglutide/Wegovy from Novo Nordisk acts through GLP1R biology. It is not one of the candidates, but it sets a high clinical bar for metabolic benefit plus histologic endpoints.
- Pegozafermin from 89bio/Roche and efruxifermin from Akero are FGF21 analog programs. They are not the same genes, but they are relevant comparators for metabolic-fibrotic trial strategy.
- Selonsertib from Gilead targeted ASK1/MAP3K5 and failed in late-stage NASH fibrosis, arguing for stronger patient selection and pharmacodynamic evidence.
- Simtuzumab from Gilead targeted LOXL2. This is adjacent to matrix-remodeling biology, but LOXL2 is not a top near-term nomination in this analysis.
- CM-101 from ChemomAb targets CCL24. It is not a direct candidate, but it is conceptually related to chemokine and inflammatory fibrosis biology, including ACKR1 context.
