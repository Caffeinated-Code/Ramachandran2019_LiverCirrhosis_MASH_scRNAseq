# Run Notes And Self-Review

## Local Runtime

- R version: 4.6.0
- Main analysis package: Seurat 5.5.0
- Package lock: `renv.lock`
- Primary input: `data/raw/GSE136103_RAW.tar`
- Main workflow: `make check`, `make curate`, `make analyze`, `make prioritize`, `make dashboard`

## Decisions Made

- Used GEO count matrices as the reproducible input.
- Kept the published Seurat object as a reference concept, not a dependency, because the assignment asks for QC and preprocessing choices.
- Excluded blood and mouse samples from the primary human liver discovery contrast.
- Used marker-supported compartment calls for the required compartments rather than overclaiming full cell-type annotation.
- Labeled Seurat cell-level DE as exploratory because donor-level pseudobulk is the better inferential strategy.
- Kept validation modular. GSE244832 was prepared and summarized for HSC/MASH validation, GSE207310 was staged for biomarker directionality, and SCP2154 remains a macrophage expansion path.
- Added public target evidence from Open Targets, ClinicalTrials.gov, ClinVar, and MyGene.info.

## Difficulties

- Seurat was not installed initially. It was installed locally and verified before analysis.
- Seurat v5 uses layered assays after merge. The workflow now calls `JoinLayers()` explicitly before marker scoring.
- `renv` initially saw an empty project library. I hydrated it from the local R library and then wrote the lockfile.
- Full object-level validation with GSE244832 was not run locally because the count matrix is large. Instead, the prepared validation script streams the matrix and aggregates ranked candidate genes by condition, cluster, and sample.
- The current DE is exploratory cell-level DE. A donor-aware pseudobulk module is the most important next improvement.

## Quality Checks Completed

- Confirmed 26 GEO libraries in the primary archive.
- Confirmed 20 primary human liver libraries were included.
- Confirmed 5 healthy and 5 cirrhotic donors were represented after inclusion.
- Checked required compartment recovery across disease states.
- Reviewed UMAP and marker dot plot figures.
- Corrected target scoring so curated macrophage genes do not borrow mesenchymal DE evidence.
- Confirmed dashboard data files were generated.
- Confirmed GSE244832 candidate-expression validation summaries were generated.
- Confirmed enriched candidate evidence table was generated.

## Highest-Value Improvements

1. Add donor-aware pseudobulk DE per refined cell state.
2. Incorporate the authors' released annotation object for reference mapping and label refinement.
3. Run focused GSE244832 validation for HSC/myofibroblast candidates.
4. Add a small public-resource annotation layer for protein class, Human Protein Atlas tissue specificity, Open Targets or ChEMBL druggability, and formal human-mouse orthology.
5. Improve cell annotation beyond three required compartments by adding hepatocyte, cholangiocyte, T/NK, B/plasma, mast, cycling, and ambiguous categories.
6. Convert markdown reports into a polished DOCX/PDF packet once the final README is rewritten.
