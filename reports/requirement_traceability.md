## Stakeholder Clarification Applied

| Clarification | Status | Evidence |
|---|---:|---|

| Include interactive visualization | Complete | `dashboard/app.R` |
| Do not track private CEO conversation | Complete | `.gitignore`, `scripts/validate_repo_structure.py`, `git status` |

## Remaining Gaps And Rationale

| Gap | Rationale | Next Step |
|---|---|---|
| Full GSE207310 computed validation | Data are staged, but files require Ensembl-to-symbol mapping and phenotype harmonization before symbol-level interpretation | Add annotation and phenotype module |
| SCP2154 macrophage atlas validation | Most useful for macrophage candidates, but portal/export logistics make it less reliable for the compact local run | Add as optional portal-dependent module |
| Full object-level GSE244832 reanalysis | Large matrix makes full local object analysis slower and less portable | Run as a separate Nextflow/AWS job |
| Ligand-receptor mechanism analysis | Addressed in written screening response, but not implemented as a code module | Add LIANA/CellChat/NicheNet module after stable cell-state annotation |
