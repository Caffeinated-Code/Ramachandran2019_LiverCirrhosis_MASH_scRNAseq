## Stakeholder Clarification Applied

| Clarification | Status | Evidence |
|---|---:|---|
| Practical-level assignment, not publication-grade | Complete | Scope and limitations in `reports/executive_submission_summary.md` and `reports/run_notes.md` |
| Show scientific thinking and single-cell/transcriptomic approach | Complete | `reports/screening_responses/README.md`, `reports/executive_summary/README.md` |

| Use blood and mouse samples without confounding the primary contrast | Complete | `workflow/13_validate_blood_mouse_markers.R`, `reports/tables/gse136103_blood_candidate_marker_role_summary.csv`, `reports/tables/gse136103_mouse_candidate_ortholog_summary.csv` |

## Remaining Gaps And Rationale

| Gap | Rationale | Next Step |
|---|---|---|
| Macrophage-focused external validation | Current validation is strongest for HSC and bulk NAFLD/NASH directionality | Add SCP2154 or another accessible macrophage atlas |
| SCP2154 macrophage atlas validation | Most useful for macrophage candidates, but portal/export logistics make it less reliable for the compact local run | Add as optional portal-dependent module |
| Full all-gene GSE244832 reanalysis | A focused Seurat object is now implemented; full all-gene reanalysis remains better suited to AWS due matrix size | Run full all-gene object generation as a cloud job |
| Expanded preclinical validation | GSE136103 mouse validation is executable and ortholog-aware, but it has one healthy and one fibrotic mouse sample | Add larger mouse MASH and fibrosis datasets to the Nextflow validation module |
| Ligand-receptor mechanism analysis | Addressed in written screening response, but not implemented as a code module | Add LIANA/CellChat/NicheNet module after stable cell-state annotation |
